Before embarking on the academic journey, I worked as a corporate strategist in Hong Kong and China for over 15 years. Some of my career highlights include:

* **Led corporate-level strategy execution** for a conglomerate, resulting in a significant rise in the Top 500 China Company ranking over four years (from 352nd to 183rd); also led business-unit level strategy formulation and implementation for a commercial bank, contributing to a threefold increase in total assets (from US$6 billion to US$20 billion) and a strengthened core competitiveness.

* **Served as VP/Director of Strategy** for two publicly listed companies, where I drove strategic direction and impact commitments that translated into strong bottom-line growth in 2021: 17% for Weiye Decoration (300621.SZ) and 53% for Huafa Property Services (00982.HK).

* **Designed and launched a successful loyalty program** that unified 14 reward schemes across different consumer businesses under a single brand; co-branded credit cards with seven banks, growing registered membership to 140 million by 2022.

* **Led marketing research** on performance evaluation and consumer behavior for various B2C businesses; supported the development of analytics capabilities and CRM enhancements, contributing to sustained improvements in Net Promoter Score and brand equity across 14 business units.

* **Hands-on project experience** in diverse sectors: commercial banking, retail and e-commerce, CPG (beverages, beer), utilities (gas, power), real estate (residential, commercial, and property management), cement, and home decoration.

These experiences help me to identify research gaps and make theories more relevant to the real world. I am eager to leverage them to explore how businesses can become more responsible and impactful.

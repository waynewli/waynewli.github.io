title: "Strategic Relocation as Stakeholder Realignment: A Process Perspective from Politically Embedded China"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This study explores a counterintuitive case of corporate headquarters (HQ) relocation in China, where a financial firm moved its HQ from a financial powerhouse back to a smaller city where it was originally incorporated. While the move appears economically irrational, this research argues that in politically embedded markets, such decisions may reflect stakeholder realignment rather than institutional compliance. Drawing on stakeholder theory and institutional perspectives, this study investigates how firms navigate competing stakeholder pressures, how stakeholder salience shifts across time and institutional levels, and how political embeddedness influences strategic decisions.'
